OSM Stories feature a collection of case studies and lessons learned from government, multilateral and non-profit institutions who use and contribute to OSM in their official line of work. We invite you to take a look or submit a case study of your own, and we hope youâ€™ll learn something from our experiences using OSM to shape policy and strengthen field projects.

OSMStories.org is maintained by the OSM Institutions community of practice, with contribution from many members of the OSM community. Individual stories have been submitted by {% for item in site.data.authors %}{% if forloop.last == false %}{{ item[1].name }}, {% else %} and {{ item[1].name }}{% endif %}{% endfor %}.
